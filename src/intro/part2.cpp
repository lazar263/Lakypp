#include <iostream> 

/**
 * 
 * #include can be listed in a group of preprocessor/precompilation directives.
 * What does that mean? 
 * That means it is being executed before the compilation process which converts our little cute code
 * to a language of ones and zeros that a machine like your computer can easily read and easily understand.
 * 
 * As soon as the inputted code is read, it will be converted to a executable by default by a compiler.
 * #include directive also has a argument, which is in this situation, a 'iostream', which roughly means it is
 * including a library, or a external file, not written by you into your program.
 * 
 * IOStream library consists of many functions and out-of-the-box functionalities that make 
 * input-output almost a no-brainer.
 * 
 * Now, after we have included iostream to our program, we can use it.
 * In case you haven't included iostream, compiler will throw errors.
